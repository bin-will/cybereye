CyberEye: Obtain Data from Virtual Desktop by Video

Abstract：
VDI is not safety and reliability anymore. VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, also called Cloud Desktop) is being widely used as working interface to avoid data exfiltration. With VDI client, end users can access internal data without obtaining data acturally.

In this paper, we present a new approach named ‘CyberEye’, to extract data from VDI by video even data transmission out of it has been disabled. By encoding data file to video, playing it in VDI meanwhile recording it in host PC, we can get full information of the data with video format, then decode it to recover original data file.

The proof-of-concept on Citrix Workspace and servral other remote virtual desktops strongly proved availability and versatility. We introduce the usage in operation model and how it designed and implementation in technical work. We have opened the source code to researchers for reproducing the work.
